## Classifying transects and stations

Prior to characterizing which station occupations belong to the AR7W transect and its stations, a methodology had to be developed. Using the station locations, Table \@ref(tab:stationCoordinates), a transect polygon was constructed, as well as polygons for each station. For the transect polygon, the first and last station was used to calculate the angle of the transect. A polygon with an arbitrarily chosen width of 14km was constructed. A polygon for each individual station was also created, these were aligned with the angle of the transect polygon. A width, here meaning along-slope, of 14km was used for consistency with the transect polygon, as well as for the length, here meaning cross-slope. In some cases, the stations are less than 14km km apart, therefore, to prevent overlap between station polygons, the inter-station distance was used for the length.

## Vertical binning

Defined depth bins follow the World Ocean Atlas standard levels which are every 5m from 0 to 100m with a tolerance of 2.5m, every 25m from 125 to 500m with a tolerance of 12.5m, every 50m from 550 to 2000m with a tolerance of 25m, and every 100m from 2100 to 4000m with a tolerance of 50m [@reagan2023woa]. The 0 to 10m bins were omitted from the analysis due to relatively low data coverage and quality. The maximum depth bin for each station is the closest bin to the median of the maximum pressure value from all profiles for the climatology reference period. Therefore, in some cases for the climatology profile plots it will appear that data is available deeper than calculated.

## Date ranges

The date range used to define the climatology is 01 May to 30 June, inclusive. Data collected during a mission outside of this date range was excluded from the climatology calculation.

## Minimum criteria

The AZOMP is, relative to climate timescales, young, with program sampling occurring for most of the recent reference period (1991 to 2020). To ensure that each station’s climatology was calculated with adequate coverage, a minimum criterion was set. The minimum of at least one occupation for any 10 years within the 30-year period was used.
