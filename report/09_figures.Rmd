(ref:fig-samplingTimeRange) Sampling time ranges, inferred from the date ranges from the CTD profiles, for the AZOMP missions.

```

(ref:fig-ar7wSamplingFrequency) Sampling frequency at each station. A light red filled box indicates that the station was not sampled, reiterated by the number zero in the box. A light green filled box indicates that the station was sampled the expected number of times, which is one. A dark green filled box indicates that the station was sampled more than the expected number of times with the total number of occupations indicated in the box. The number on the right axis indicates the number of years the station was sampled at least once. Station names in bold on the left axis indicates that the station has been sampled at least once for less than 10 years.

```

(ref:fig-ar7wSamplingTiming) The sampling timing of each station, colour coded by year.
