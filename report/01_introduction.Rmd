# Introduction {#sec:introduction}

During the 1980s, the planning of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) began, and the first year of its implementation was in year 1990 [@thompson2001]. The WOCE sampling included One time Survey Sections as well as Repeat Sections \textcolor{red}{CITE}. One of the repeat sections, that Canada committed to, is the Atlantic Repeat Hydrography Line 7 West (AR7W) \textcolor{red}{CITE}. Since the commitment, the AR7W was absorbed into the Atlantic Zone Off-Shelf Monitoring Program (AZOMP), and is the core objective of the program. The AR7W consists of 28 core stations covering the Labrador Shelf (AR7W-W), stations AR7W_01 to AR7W_10, across the central Labrador Sea (AR7W-C), stations AR7W_11 to AR7W_23, and the Greenland shelf (AR7W-E), stations AR7W_24 to AR7W_28 (Figure \@ref(fig:map)) [@li2014]. In year \textcolor{red}{XXXX}, half stations, which are between stations along AR7W-C and AR7W-E, were added \textcolor{red}{for some reason}.

For monitoring efforts, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) recommends using reference period of years 1961 to 1990 as well as the most recent three decades [@wmo2017]. Since the inception of the AZOMP was much later than the proposed reference period and available data within some reasonably defined area for each station is assumed to be sparse, calculations using the reference period for years 1961 to 1990 will not be considered. Instead, the most recent overlapping three-decade periods, years 1991 to 2020, will be presented.
