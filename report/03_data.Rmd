Continuous downcast CTD data from the AZOMP for years 1993 to 2020 was obtained by mission name, Table \@ref(tab:missionIds).  For year 1992, data was obtained from CLIVAR and Carbon Hydrographic Data Office (CCHDO) [@CCHDO2025]. A mission did occur in year 1991, but there were data quality concerns due to technical issues with the instrumentation. Quality control flags were applied to the data when available.
